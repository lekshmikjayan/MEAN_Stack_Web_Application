# MeanCourse

Full-stack web solution that leverages MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js to enable efficient and scalable development of dynamic web applications with a NoSQL database backend and a responsive front-end user interface.

## IMPORTANT FEATURES

* MongoDB: 
      - A NoSQL database that stores data flexible and is used to persist application data and provides scalability and performance advantages.
      
* Express.js:
      - A flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web applications and APIs. 
      - It simplifies server-side development and handles routing, middleware, and HTTP requests.
      
* Angular: 
      - JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications.
      - It provides a comprehensive set of tools and libraries for front-end development, including declarative templates, data binding, and dependency injection.
     
* Node.js:
      -  It allows you to run JavaScript code outside the browser, making it ideal for server-side development. 
      -  Node.js provides event-driven, non-blocking I/O capabilities and a vast ecosystem of modules.

* RESTful APIs: 
      - For standardized and stateless communication between the server and client MEAN stack applications commonly use RESTful APIs to expose data and functionality to client-side applications.

* Deployment: 
     - This involves building the client-side code, setting up environment variables, and deploying to hosting platforms or server environments.

* Server-side Code: 
    - This includes the server-side logic implemented using Node.js and Express.js. 
    - It involves defining routes, handling HTTP requests, connecting to the database, and performing business logic.

* Client-side Code: 
    - This refers to the code executed in the browser using Angular. 
    - It includes components, services, directives, and other Angular-specific constructs that handle user interactions, render views, and communicate with the server-side API.
