# MeanCourse

Full-stack web solution that leverages MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js to enable efficient and scalable development of dynamic web applications with a NoSQL database backend and a responsive front-end user interface.

## IMPORTANT FEATURES

* MongoDB is the NoSQL database that stores data flexible and is used to persist application data and provides scalability and performance advantages.  
* Express.js is flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web applications and APIs. 
      - It simplifies server-side development and handles routing, middleware, and HTTP requests. 
* Angular is JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications.
      - It provides a comprehensive set of tools and libraries for front-end development, including declarative templates, data binding, and dependency injection.
* Node.js allows you to run JavaScript code outside the browser, making it ideal for server-side development. 
      -  It provides event-driven, non-blocking I/O capabilities and a vast ecosystem of modules.
* RESTful APIs used for standardized and stateless communication between the server and client MEAN stack applications commonly use RESTful APIs to expose data and functionality to client-side applications.
* Deployment involves building the client-side code, setting up environment variables, and deploying to hosting platforms or server environments.
* Server-side Code includes the server-side logic implemented using Node.js and Express.js. 
    - It involves defining routes, handling HTTP requests, connecting to the database, and performing business logic.
* Client-side Code refers to the code executed in the browser using Angular. 
    - It includes components, services, directives, and other Angular-specific constructs that handle user interactions, render views, and communicate with the server-side API.
